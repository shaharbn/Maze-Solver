# Maze‑Solver

A Python program that generates, displays and automatically solves mazes.  
Features both a text‑based and GUI interface, supports multiple solving algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*), and includes unit tests.

---


## Features

- **Maze generation**: randomized depth‑first backtracking  
- **Algoritem solver**: DFS 
- **Visualization**: real‑time drawing of maze and solution path  
- **Modular design**: clean separation of maze logic, point/cell models, and display  
- **Unit tests**: verify maze connectivity and solver correctness

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- `tkinter` for GUI
